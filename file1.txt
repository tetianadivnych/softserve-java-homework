My name is Tetiana Divnych.
My birthdate is 24.01.1997.
I had spent my career in sales and marketing until I quit my job in November 2021.
Since January 2022 until December 2022 I was learning programming and Java Core on my own.
Since December 2022 I have been taking an online course «Java Developer» from SoftServe.
Today is 20.02.2023, and it’s almost 2 months since I am taking the course.
